#### Brief Description of our Solution - 
##### Monitoring temperature is one of the vital and common tasks performed by many industries.Temperature monitoring is widely used in various processes like automotive industries, air conditioning, power plant, and other industries that need the data to be saved and analyzed. There are several monitoring systems periodically. The main purpose of this system model is to make it easy for the user to view  existing to measure and analyze temperature data the current temperature. One of the most efficient monitoring systems that can be used to fulfill this task is the Internet of things-based temperature monitoring system. The proposed solution is an IoT system that can sense the current ambient temperature.Depending on the current read temperature, an indicator will move on a display gauge such it indicates how the temperature changes in a way categorizing temperature levels less than 20 deg. Celsius as Cool, temperature level between 20 and 30 deg. Celsius as Warm and temperature level above 30 deg. Celsius as Hot. Then the system will display a visualization of past data, data coming from the sensors on a Node-RED dashboard and predict the temperature up to 12 months ahead. It is expected to use the ARIMA model for the prediction. Ultimately all these components will automate the process of temperature monitoring through an IoT device.
